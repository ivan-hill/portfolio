Junior Web Development Portfolio 

Hi, my name is Ivan Hill and I am a Junior Front-End Developer. As a developer,I am knowledgeable in conducting program test and debug all web applications. Design, develop, test and deploy web applications and the principles I live by. My goal is to use my skills in uploading sites onto server and registering it with different search engines. Coordinating with other designers and programmers to develop web projects , in a real world environment is the final piece to my puzzle.

 Things that I offer:

-Fix bugs, troubleshoot and resolve problems in case of system failure. 

-initiate periodic testing and implement contingency plans.

-Develop appropriate code structures to solve specific tasks in  the development and maintenance of websites.

-Assume ownership of code throughout staging, development, testing and production.

-Professionally provide expertise in an expanding array of Front-End web development services. 

Please contact me at your earliest convenience, to discuss whether my skill set would be a good fit for your organization.

Best Regards, 
Ivan Hill
